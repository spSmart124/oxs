Introduction
Vocal For Local (VFL)
This is a productivity tool for GCS Engineers working on cases.
It addresses challenges in managing logs, files, screenshots etc. collected in a case and taking notes on the observation by the engineer.
It gives a dedicated/unified folder for a case directly associated with corresponding Salesforce case.
It has a browser extension to create folder and template file associated with case by prepopulating important details like orgid, POD, secure agent name, case description etc.
It will open the folder created in Windows Explorer and open the template file created in your text editor of choice (e.g Notepad++)
